The Constellation PHP library is composed of 2 primiary pieces:

- Constellation.php
- ConstellationDelegate.php

To initialize an instance of Constellation is as easy as ::

require 'path/to/Constellation.php';
$constellation         = new Constellation();
$constellation_handler = new ConstellationHandler();
$constellation->setDelegate($constellation_handler);

Constellation.php is the core command class that talks to Galaxy to retrieve it's data

ConstellationDelegate.php is an interface that is required by all Constellation instances.  ConstellationDelegate.php provides all of your override points for any action Constellation will perform.
